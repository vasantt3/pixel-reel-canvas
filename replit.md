# Cinematic Video Portfolio

## Project Overview
A modern, cinematic video portfolio website showcasing film and video production work. The project has been successfully migrated from Lovable to Replit with proper client/server separation and security practices.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Wouter routing (migrated from React Router for Replit compatibility)
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Vite development setup
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cinematic design system
- **Components**: Shadcn/ui component library

## Recent Changes (July 20, 2025)
- ✅ Migrated routing from React Router DOM to Wouter for Replit compatibility
- ✅ Fixed CSS import order issues (moved @import to top of file)
- ✅ Added missing dependencies (react-router-dom, sonner)
- ✅ Created queryClient setup for TanStack Query
- ✅ Simplified Home page to single screen with no scrolling sections
- ✅ Updated Home page to show only auto-playing looped video
- ✅ Added custom CSS animations and utility classes
- ✅ Fixed navigation component to use Wouter hooks

## Current Status

- Minimal home page with auto-playing video background (loops automatically)
- Working navigation between Home, Work, and Contact pages
- Responsive design with dark theme

- Express server running on port 5000

## User Preferences
